# OOP_FantasySportsTeamManagementSimulation

## Overview
The **Fantasy Sports Team Management Simulation** is an object-oriented programming (OOP) project designed to simulate the management of fantasy sports teams. This project demonstrates the use of OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in Java. It was created as a part of an educational exercise to showcase the application of OOP concepts in a real-world scenario.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on example of how OOP principles can be applied to create a robust and flexible software system. By simulating a fantasy sports team management system, the project aims to illustrate how different classes and objects can interact with each other to achieve a common goal. This project is particularly useful for students and developers who are learning OOP and want to see practical implementations of these concepts.

## Features
- **Team Management**: Create and manage multiple teams.
- **Player Management**: Add and remove players from teams.
- **Player Performance**: Calculate and display player performance based on their position.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Use of the `new` keyword to dynamically allocate memory for teams and players.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: Git

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files and directories:

- `Main.java`: The entry point of the application, demonstrating the creation of teams and players, updating player stats, and displaying team information.
- `Player.java`: Contains the abstract `PlayerBase` class and its concrete subclasses `Striker` and `Goalkeeper`, representing different types of players.
- `Team.java`: Represents a sports team, including methods to add and remove players, display team information, and track the total number of teams.
- `.idea/`: Contains IDE-specific configuration files.
- `S53_JasonWilliam_OOP_FantasySportsTeamManagementSimulation.iml`: Module file for IntelliJ IDEA.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code).
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file to start the simulation.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive example of how OOP principles can be effectively utilized to build a functional and maintainable software system. By working through this project, developers can gain a deeper understanding of OOP concepts and their practical applications in software development.
